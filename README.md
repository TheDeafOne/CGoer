# About CGoer
At Grove City College, we're required to either go to chapel or "make up" missed chapels by watching a recorded chapel and write an essay about it. \
I don't want to go to chapel, but I also don't want to watch a bunch of videos and write a bunch of essays. To avoid this I've created a bot called CGoer which takes the following process:
* grabs a vimeo link from the user (GCC uses vimeo to keep records on chapels)
* transcribes the video
* uses chatGPT to sumarize the video given the transcription
* outputs the summary
